## SMART PARKING SYSTEM 

in this project the smart parking system  is created by interfacing matlab with arduino,

### key features of system :
* the system can detect the  total number of vehicles waiting in parking, and 
* provides a graphical interface in both software and hardware manner to the operator(gate keeper) to open the  parking gate ,
* if operator is absent the system can be run in auto mode ( i.e. system has both auto and manual working behaviour)
* securitiy of the vehicles is monitered by vibration sensor mechanism and alarm system 
* matlab gui app + arduino harware interface 

### present files in the repository :

 1. demo video of working of smart parking system 
 2. matlab app of software
 3. push button manual file ( extras)
 4. refernce books for interfacing matlab gui and arduino
 5.  problem statement of the project
